            In the beginning, Tim create the HyperText Markup Language.
            The internet was without form and void, and text was upon the
            face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the
            face of the keyboard. And time said, Let there be links; and
            there were links. And time saw that the links were good; and
            Tim seperated the links for the text. Tim called the links
            Anchors, and the text he called Other Stuff. And the whole
            thing together was the first Web Page.
