# FizzBuzz
When it counts you Fizz Buzz. A JavaScript coding exercise using loops. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3' display "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of '5' display "Buzz." If the number is a multiple of both display "FizzBuzz." Interesting side note, this is actually My first time ever doing the classic FizzBuzz Challenge. Enjoy!
